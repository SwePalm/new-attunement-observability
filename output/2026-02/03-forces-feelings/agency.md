## A. Systemic Contradictions (The Engine of the Story)
Contradiction 1 (Political vs. Social):
Institutions are incentivized to accelerate agent deployment for service performance, while citizens increasingly demand slower, accountable intervention when automated decisions cause harm.
Contradiction 2 (Economic vs. Legal):
Organizations pursue margin gains through wider delegation, but expanding deployer duties and liability exposure make each additional autonomous action harder to defend.
Contradiction 3 (Philosophical vs. Lived Reality):
The public narrative frames AI agency as human empowerment, yet daily experience often feels like negotiating with systems that act first and explain later.

## B. The Normalization of the Absurd (The Tone)
Normal Absurdity 1:
People routinely ask whether a decision came from a person, a policy engine, or an agent chain before they decide to trust it.
Normal Absurdity 2:
Teams spend more time producing audit-ready evidence that they supervised automation correctly than doing the original task manually.
Normal Absurdity 3:
Service interactions begin with disclosure and liability-routing language before anyone addresses the practical issue.

## C. The Single, Irreplaceable Thing
The Irreplaceable Thing:
Credible human accountability at the moment of harm.
Explanation:
In this world, speed and convenience are abundant, but trust remains scarce because automated systems can execute consequences faster than institutions can absorb responsibility. People can accept delegated action when they believe a real person with authority can intervene, explain, and repair when outcomes are wrong. Without that, every efficiency gain feels reversible and brittle. The rare, non-automatable act is accountable ownership under pressure: someone who can stop the process, accept near-term institutional risk, and restore legitimacy in public view. That accountable presence becomes the social anchor of agency.
