## A. Systemic Contradictions (The Engine of the Story)
Contradiction 1 (Political vs. Social):
Institutions are incentivized to accelerate AI-enabled Truth processes, while society demands slower accountable intervention when harm occurs.
Contradiction 2 (Economic vs. Legal):
Organizations pursue efficiency gains through delegation, but liability and compliance obligations raise the cost of poorly governed autonomy.
Contradiction 3 (Philosophical vs. Lived Reality):
Public narratives describe AI as expanding human potential, while daily experience often feels like negotiating with systems that decide before explaining.

## B. The Normalization of the Absurd (The Tone)
Normal Absurdity 1:
People routinely ask whether a consequential outcome came from a person, a policy engine, or an automated workflow chain.
Normal Absurdity 2:
Teams spend more effort documenting responsible oversight than performing the original routine task.
Normal Absurdity 3:
Support channels start with disclosure and liability routing before addressing the practical problem.

## C. The Single, Irreplaceable Thing
The Irreplaceable Thing:
Credible accountable intervention in moments of institutional harm.
Explanation:
In this world, speed and convenience are common, but trust remains scarce because automated processes can produce consequences faster than institutions can absorb responsibility. People accept AI participation when they believe a real accountable actor can intervene, explain, and repair under pressure. Without that assurance, even high-performing systems feel brittle. The scarce social resource is not raw capability but accountable presence with authority to pause, correct, and own outcomes.
