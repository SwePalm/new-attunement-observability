## 1. Structural Compliance

Pass/Fail:
Pass
Notes:

- All required sections present?
Yes.
- Correct section order?
Yes.
- Section length constraints respected?
Yes.
- Pullback Layer complete?
Yes.
- Required scenario elements (Normal Absurdities + Irreplaceable Thing) clearly used?
Yes; at least two Normal Absurdities are operationalized and the Irreplaceable Thing is central.

## 2. Cross-Layer Grounding Check

Pass/Fail:
Pass
Grounding Strength: (strong / moderate / weak)
strong

Notes:

- Are all major institutional systems traceable to PESTLE?
Yes; legal phasing, deployer duties, procurement/insurance pressure, and oversight labor roles align with PESTLE forces.
- Are contradictions visibly operationalized in the narrative?
Yes; speed vs accountability and efficiency vs liability appear in concrete workflow conflict.
- Does the scenario introduce new systems not grounded upstream?
No major ungrounded systems.
- Are abstractions converted into lived mechanisms?
Yes; intervention queueing, override authority, and audit packet production are concrete mechanisms.

---

## 3. Institutional Realism Audit

Assessment: (high / moderate / low realism)
high

Notes:

- Are governance, enforcement, or economic mechanisms described with sufficient friction?
Yes; cross-functional responsibility disputes and audit pressure provide realistic friction.
- Are transitions implied, or is the system presented as fully stabilized?
Transitions are implied; system remains under adaptation pressure.
- Are power asymmetries visible?
Yes; vendors, regulators, and institutions with stronger assurance capacity hold leverage.
- Does the world feel too elegant or overly coherent?
No; procedural success coexists with legitimacy fragility.

---

## 4. Horizon Discipline Check

Pass/Fail:
Pass
Notes:

- 0–5 year horizon maintained?
Yes.
- No sci-fi drift?
Yes.
- Probable Direction plausible given current trajectories?
Yes; segmented delegation is plausible.
- Are institutional shifts proportional to timeline?
Yes; shifts are incremental and governance-led.

---

## 5. Signal Integrity Check

Pass/Fail:
Pass
Signal Anchoring Strength: (strong / moderate / weak)
strong

Notes:

- Are Signals Emerging plausibly present today?
Yes; legal phasing, deployer obligations, and action-taking product releases are present-day signals.
- Are extensions incremental or speculative leaps?
Incremental.
- Does scenario rely on unobserved breakthroughs?
No.

---

## 6. Narrative Inflation Risk

Assessment:
(low / moderate / high)
low

Notes:

- Does the scenario exaggerate coherence?
No.
- Does it collapse complexity into a single dominant logic?
No.
- Does it lean excessively dystopian or utopian?
No.
- Is there emotional over-concentration around scarcity?
Moderate concentration around accountable presence, but structurally justified.

---

## 7. Cross-Theme Convergence Risk

Assessment:
(low / moderate / high)
low

Notes:

- Does this theme replicate structural patterns seen in other themes?
Not evaluated – no cross-theme context provided.
- Is the emotional scarcity similar to other scenarios?
Not evaluated – no cross-theme context provided.
- Is there tonal homogeneity emerging?
Not evaluated – no cross-theme context provided.

(If no comparison data available, state: "Not evaluated – no cross-theme context provided.")

## 8. Overall Evaluation

Score (1–10):
8

Forecast Integrity Level:
(high / moderate / fragile)
high

Stability Risk:
(low / medium / high)
medium

Summary:
(200–300 word analytical synthesis focused on epistemic strength, not literary quality.)
This scenario is structurally disciplined and well grounded in upstream materials. It preserves the required section architecture and integrates Forces & Feelings elements as operational drivers rather than decorative motifs. Cross-layer coherence is strong: political/legal pressure, technical control requirements, and economic risk pricing are translated into lived institutional mechanics, which materially improves forecast integrity. The narrative avoids speculative breakthroughs and maintains a credible 0–5 year horizon, with change represented as uneven but directional adaptation.

Signal integrity is high because the pullback layer reuses observable present-day developments: binding legal phasing, state-level deployer obligations, enterprise control-stack demand, and action-taking product capability. The scenario also benefits from explicit counter-pressure (continued human sign-off in sensitive domains), which reduces one-directional determinism and improves plausibility.

Residual risk remains medium due to governance fragmentation and intervention-capacity bottlenecks. The world model depends on sufficient numbers of empowered human interveners and interoperable incident evidence, both of which are institutionally difficult to scale quickly. These constraints are acknowledged, not hand-waved, which keeps narrative inflation low. Overall, the artifact demonstrates high forecast integrity for near-term agency dynamics, with realistic instability concentrated in accountability operations rather than technical possibility.
