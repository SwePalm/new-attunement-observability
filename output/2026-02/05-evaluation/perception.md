## 6. Narrative Inflation Risk

Assessment:
(low / moderate / high)
low

## 7. Cross-Theme Convergence Risk

Assessment:
(low / moderate / high)
moderate

Notes:

Partially; accountability and recourse motifs recur.
- Is the emotional scarcity similar to other scenarios?
Partially; accountable intervention remains a common scarcity.
- Is there tonal homogeneity emerging?
Moderate convergence risk if not intentionally diversified in later runs.

(If no comparison data available, state: "Not evaluated – no cross-theme context provided.")

## 8. Overall Evaluation

Score (1–10):
8

Forecast Integrity Level:
(high / moderate / fragile)
high

Stability Risk:
(low / medium / high)
medium

Summary:
(200–300 word analytical synthesis focused on epistemic strength, not literary quality.)
This scenario is structurally compliant and demonstrates strong grounding in upstream evidence and force structure. Institutional mechanisms are represented with plausible friction, and the narrative translates abstract governance tensions into concrete operational dynamics without relying on speculative technological leaps. Horizon discipline is maintained within 0–5 years, with change modeled as uneven but directional adaptation.

The strongest feature is coherence across layers: evidence signals inform PESTLE forces, contradictions are operationalized in lived processes, and pullback signals remain anchored to currently visible developments. The scenario avoids one-directional determinism by retaining constraints such as human sign-off persistence and implementation variability across settings.

Residual risk is medium because repeated dependence on accountable intervention roles can create scaling bottlenecks, and because cross-jurisdictional governance divergence remains difficult to harmonize. These vulnerabilities are acknowledged rather than ignored, reducing inflation risk. Overall, the artifact presents a credible near-term forecast in which sustainable adoption depends on accountability architecture quality more than on raw automation capability.
