strong

Notes:

- Are Signals Emerging plausibly present today?
Yes.

## 6. Narrative Inflation Risk

Assessment:
(low / moderate / high)
low

Notes:

- Does the scenario exaggerate coherence?
No.
- Does it collapse complexity into a single dominant logic?
No.
- Does it lean excessively dystopian or utopian?
No.
- Is there emotional over-concentration around scarcity?
Moderate but controlled.

---

## 7. Cross-Theme Convergence Risk

Assessment:
(low / moderate / high)
high

Notes:

- Does this theme replicate structural patterns seen in other themes?
Partially; there is shared governance architecture language across the corpus.
- Is the emotional scarcity similar to other scenarios?
Partially.
- Is there tonal homogeneity emerging?
Moderate convergence risk where distinctiveness score is lower.

(If no comparison data available, state: "Not evaluated – no cross-theme context provided.")

## 8. Overall Evaluation

Score (1–10):
8.9

Forecast Integrity Level:
(high / moderate / fragile)
high

Stability Risk:
(low / medium / high)
low

Summary:
(200–300 word analytical synthesis focused on epistemic strength, not literary quality.)
This scenario shows high forecast integrity for the perception theme, with strong cross-layer grounding and plausible institutional mechanics. The artifact maintains near-term discipline and translates upstream tensions into lived mechanisms rather than abstract framing. Signal handling is strong, with scenario indicators traceable to evidence-layer trajectories. Inflation risk remains low, supported by bounded claims and explicit governance friction. Distinctiveness versus other themes is low, indicating convergence pressure in shared operating motifs while retaining theme framing. Residual risk is concentrated in coordination and scaling: accountable intervention capacity, legal fragmentation, and implementation variance can reduce stability even when baseline outputs are coherent. Overall, the scenario is useful for decision framing, with a score of 8.9/10 in this first monthly corpus.

Subscores:
