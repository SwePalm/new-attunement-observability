Structural Question:
Will legal and institutional accountability for AI agents in high-impact workflows mature fast enough in the next 24 months to support scaled delegation without trust breakdown?

Why It Matters:
AI systems are moving from recommendation to action across customer service, operations, compliance, and public administration. In this transition, failures are no longer only model-quality failures; they become governance failures about who authorized the action, who can intervene, and who is accountable for harm. The next 6–24 months are a structural hinge: institutions that operationalize accountability architecture early will scale safely, while those that optimize for speed alone will face legal, political, and legitimacy shocks.

Volatility Level:
high
