Structural Question:
Will legal and institutional accountability for AI agents in high-impact workflows mature fast enough in the next 24 months to allow scaled delegation without systemic trust collapse?

Why It Matters:
Agency is shifting from recommendation to delegated action, where systems do not just advise but execute tasks across procurement, operations, customer service, and personal workflows. When execution moves faster than governance, a single design flaw can become a distributed institutional failure rather than an isolated product bug. The next 6-24 months will determine whether accountability is embedded as a precondition for deployment or retrofitted after public harm, with major consequences for adoption velocity and legitimacy.

Volatility Level:
high
