Structural Question:
Will institutions build accountable Human-AI operating norms for Identity fast enough in the next 24 months to scale adoption without legitimacy shocks?

Why It Matters:
The Identity domain is becoming operational as AI systems move from advisory support to delegated execution in everyday institutional workflows. This increases speed and reach, but it also raises new risks around responsibility allocation, intervention rights, and social trust when outcomes are contested. The next 6–24 months will determine whether deployment patterns mature into durable governance structures or remain brittle, high-variance experiments.

Volatility Level:
high
