### Political
Core Shift Thesis:
AI agency governance is shifting from abstract ethics to enforceable administrative architectures, with public legitimacy hinging on visible accountability pathways.
Forces:
1. Governments are moving toward phased AI compliance regimes that force institutions to map risk classes, controls, and oversight duties before full-scale deployment.
2. Public-sector procurement is increasingly requiring auditable governance artifacts, turning buying power into a policy enforcement mechanism.
3. Cross-border policy divergence is producing governance fragmentation, pressuring institutions to design for jurisdiction-specific constraints.
4. Political scrutiny now concentrates on recourse mechanisms after harm, not only pre-launch safety claims.

### Economic
Core Shift Thesis:
Delegated AI execution is becoming a productivity engine, but economic value is increasingly tied to assurance capacity rather than automation speed alone.
Forces:
1. Enterprise budgets are shifting from chatbot experimentation to agent operations, orchestration, and reliability tooling.
2. Insurers and contractual counterparties are pricing risk into agent-led workflows, making accountability maturity a cost variable.
3. Compliance engineering is becoming a material operating expense and a barrier to entry for smaller firms.
4. Labor economics are rebalancing toward exception handling, supervision, and governance roles as routine execution is automated.

### Social
Core Shift Thesis:
Society is renegotiating trust norms around delegated action, demanding disclosure and recourse where agency affects identity, rights, or dignity.
Forces:
1. Users increasingly expect to know when they are interacting with an AI system in consequential human-facing contexts.
2. Perceived fairness now depends on the availability of human escalation when automated decisions fail or feel misaligned.
3. Professional identity tensions rise as workers shift from direct execution to oversight of automated processes.
4. Legitimacy increasingly depends on institutions showing responsibility acceptance rather than procedural deflection.

### Technological
Core Shift Thesis:
Technical progress is moving from response generation to real-world action execution, making controllability and observability central design requirements.
Forces:
1. Agent capabilities now include multi-step tool use and environment interaction, reducing the gap between intent and execution.
2. Operational controls such as permissions, approvals, and action boundaries are becoming default components of enterprise deployments.
3. Traceability infrastructure (event logs, replayability, policy telemetry) is becoming necessary for incident analysis and compliance defense.
4. Reliability work is shifting toward instruction hierarchy, constrained execution, and safe failure behavior under ambiguity.

### Legal
Core Shift Thesis:
Legal regimes are transitioning from voluntary principles to enforceable duties around disclosure, risk management, and accountability allocation.
Forces:
1. Regional AI statutes and regulations are introducing concrete obligations with phased enforcement timelines.
2. Contract law is absorbing governance duties through indemnities, audit clauses, and incident disclosure requirements.
3. Liability exposure is expanding from model defects to deployment design failures, including inadequate human oversight structures.
4. Documentation quality is becoming a legal asset, influencing defensibility after contested outcomes.

### Environmental
Core Shift Thesis:
The environmental footprint of agentic deployment is becoming a governance issue as organizations scale always-on inference and workflow automation.
Forces:
1. Growing inference demand from persistent agent operations increases pressure on data center energy use and cooling infrastructure.
2. Corporate sustainability commitments are pushing procurement teams to include energy efficiency and reporting criteria in AI platform selection.
3. Infrastructure concentration in regions with constrained grids raises political and planning friction around expansion.
4. Efficiency incentives are promoting smaller, task-specific model routing for routine automation workloads.
