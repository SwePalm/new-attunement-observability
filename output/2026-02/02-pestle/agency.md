### Political
Core Shift Thesis:
AI agency governance is shifting from voluntary guidance to enforceable accountability design, with legitimacy tied to who can intervene and answer for harm.
Forces:
1. Phased legal regimes are forcing governments and public institutions to operationalize risk-tiered oversight before full-scale deployment.
2. Procurement frameworks increasingly require evidence of escalation pathways and accountable ownership for high-impact workflows.
3. Political scrutiny is moving from abstract safety claims to post-incident responsibility performance.
4. Human sign-off retention in sensitive domains slows policy appetite for full autonomy, reinforcing hybrid governance models.

### Economic
Core Shift Thesis:
Delegated execution creates productivity upside, but value capture increasingly depends on governance maturity and defensible risk allocation.
Forces:
1. Enterprise spending is shifting toward agent operations stacks that combine automation with control, monitoring, and approval gates.
2. Contracts and insurance are pricing liability exposure for agent-mediated failures, increasing the cost of weak oversight.
3. Assurance tooling and compliance functions are becoming core operating costs rather than discretionary add-ons.
4. Reliability uncertainty in edge cases tempers expected ROI timelines for high-stakes deployment.

### Social
Core Shift Thesis:
Social acceptance is becoming conditional: people tolerate automated speed when recourse and accountable intervention remain credible.
Forces:
1. Disclosure expectations are rising in human-facing contexts where users may confuse automated action with direct human agency.
2. Trust increasingly depends on visible escalation rights when automated outcomes affect dignity, rights, or livelihood.
3. Work identities are shifting toward exception handling and accountable oversight, not only task execution.
4. Public legitimacy degrades quickly when institutions respond to harm with procedural deflection instead of ownership.

### Technological
Core Shift Thesis:
Technology is moving from conversational assistance to action-executing systems, making controllability and traceability central to deployment.
Forces:
1. Agent products now execute multi-step tasks in live software environments, tightening the link between model behavior and real-world consequence.
2. Permission scopes, runtime constraints, and approval checkpoints are becoming standard technical controls for delegated workflows.
3. Operational telemetry and replayable logs are becoming necessary for incident reconstruction and compliance defense.
4. Performance narratives are broadening from capability benchmarks to reliability under bounded execution.

### Legal
Core Shift Thesis:
Legal systems are progressively assigning explicit deployer responsibilities, narrowing the space for accountability ambiguity.
Forces:
1. EU and state-level legal developments are creating enforceable obligations around risk management, transparency, and oversight structure.
2. Liability is expanding from model defects to deployment-governance failures, including inadequate intervention design.
3. Documentation quality is increasingly central to legal defensibility after contested outcomes.
4. Jurisdictional fragmentation is driving legal architecture-by-market rather than single global policy templates.

### Environmental
Core Shift Thesis:
As agent usage scales, environmental constraints are becoming a practical governance factor in deployment strategy.
Forces:
1. Persistent inference and orchestration workloads raise operational energy demand and infrastructure planning pressure.
2. Procurement and governance decisions increasingly consider efficiency tradeoffs between larger general systems and constrained task-specific routing.
3. Public and corporate sustainability requirements are pushing for clearer reporting on AI operational footprint.
4. Cost and grid constraints may favor selective delegation in contexts where full automation is not materially superior.
