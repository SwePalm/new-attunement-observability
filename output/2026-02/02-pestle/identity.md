### Political
Core Shift Thesis:
Political legitimacy in Identity increasingly depends on accountable governance of AI-enabled decisions, not only on service efficiency claims.
Forces:
1. Binding oversight requirements are moving accountability duties from guidance into enforceable operating rules.
2. Public procurement is requiring auditable recourse and intervention pathways for AI-mediated workflows.
3. Political scrutiny is concentrating on post-incident response quality.
4. Hybrid governance remains necessary where human sign-off requirements persist.

### Economic
Core Shift Thesis:
Economic value in Identity is now tied to governance maturity as much as to automation throughput.
Forces:
1. Budget allocation is shifting toward monitoring, controls, and reliability operations.
2. Liability-aware contracts and insurance terms are pricing weak oversight as direct cost.
3. Assurance operations are becoming core functions in deployment economics.
4. Edge-case uncertainty continues moderating expected returns in high-stakes use.

### Social
Core Shift Thesis:
Social trust in Identity is increasingly conditional on disclosure, recourse, and visible responsibility.
Forces:
1. Stakeholders expect clarity on when and how AI participates in consequential decisions.
2. Escalation rights are becoming central to perceived fairness.
3. Professional identity is shifting toward exception handling and accountable review.
4. Legitimacy declines when institutions prioritize procedural closure over harm repair.

### Technological
Core Shift Thesis:
Technical adoption in Identity is advancing from assistance to bounded action, increasing demand for controllability.
Forces:
1. Tool-using and workflow-executing systems are becoming operationally routine.
2. Permission controls and runtime constraints are now standard architecture components.
3. Incident telemetry and replayability support accountability and compliance defense.
4. Reliability under governance constraints is becoming a primary selection criterion.

### Legal
Core Shift Thesis:
Legal structures in Identity are narrowing accountability ambiguity through deployer-centered obligations.
Forces:
1. Enforceable transparency, oversight, and risk-management duties are expanding.
2. Liability exposure includes governance design failures, not only model defects.
3. Documentation quality is increasingly decisive in legal defensibility.
4. Jurisdictional divergence requires market-specific compliance architecture.

### Environmental
Core Shift Thesis:
Environmental constraints are becoming a practical design factor in scaling Identity-related AI operations.
Forces:
1. Persistent inference workloads increase pressure on energy and infrastructure planning.
2. Efficiency and sustainability criteria are entering procurement and governance requirements.
3. Operational design choices increasingly weigh performance against footprint constraints.
4. Selective delegation patterns emerge where full automation is not resource-efficient.
