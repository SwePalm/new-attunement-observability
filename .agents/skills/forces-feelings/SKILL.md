# forces-feelings

## Purpose
Create the “engine” for scenario-writing by defining:
- Systemic contradictions
- Normalization of the absurd
- The single, irreplaceable thing

## Inputs
You will be given:
- `theme` (string)
- `exploration_output` (text)
- `pestle_output` (text)
- `evidence_layer` (text)

## Output contract (strict)
Return exactly these sections:

## A. Systemic Contradictions (The Engine of the Story)
Contradiction 1 (Political vs. Social):
Contradiction 2 (Economic vs. Legal):
Contradiction 3 (Philosophical vs. Lived Reality):

## B. The Normalization of the Absurd (The Tone)
Normal Absurdity 1:
Normal Absurdity 2:
Normal Absurdity 3:

## C. The Single, Irreplaceable Thing
The Irreplaceable Thing:
Explanation:
(100–150 words)

## Constraints
- Contradictions must be genuine tensions (not two synonyms).
- At least two contradictions must explicitly reference PESTLE category interactions.
- At least 1 systemic contradiction must be directly grounded in evidence_layer contradictions or regulatory/capital/technical tensions.
- Normal Absurdities must be plausible daily-life norms (not tech specs).
- At least 1 Normal Absurdity must be a plausible lived-expression of an evidence_layer item.
- Irreplaceable Thing must be emotional/social/physical and scarce in-world.
- No scenario prose here. This is scaffolding, not story.

## Quality checks before finalizing
- Contradictions are “generative”: you can imagine conflict arising from them.
- Normal Absurdities feel mundane *inside* the world, shocking *outside* it.
- Irreplaceable Thing is something a protagonist could actively pursue.
